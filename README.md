# The National Construction Code (aka Building Code of Australia) as machine readable rules?

This repository is an exploration of codifying the National Construction Code of Australia as a set of simple set of machine readable statements which are both human and machine readable, e.g. by utilising the simple syntax of if-this-then-that, any rule within the NCC can be transformed into a simple grammatical statement which can be understood and read by both human and machine.

## Why build a database of the National Construction Code which can be understood by both humans and machines?

Disclaimer: please note, the suggestion that the NCC/BCA could be written so that both humans and machines can understand it, is not a proposal for humans (building surveyors, architects, construction workers) to be replaced by a machine.  Rather, by making the NCC a document which can be more easily understood by machines, we also make the building code more easily understood by humans.

  * Scope:  Supplement the ability by the humans involved in construction of buildings (building surveyors, building inspecttors, architects, builder-owners, builders, construction workers) to keep track of multiple building code regulations by enabling machines to simultanesouly track and remind humans about which building code rules need to checked and followed-up.
  * Aim: Build a federally recognised database of the National Construction Code which encodes the Building Code of Australia into simple machine readable rules which can be easily used by humans to help track compliance of their builds.
  * Objectives:
    - [x] transform the National Construction Code (Australia) into a set of simple machine/human readable statements which can be easily tracked by machines in collaboration with humans.
    - [ ] work with other leigslation as code projects to agree semantics and shared ontologies.
