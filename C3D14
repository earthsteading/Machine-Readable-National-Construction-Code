C2D14 aka C2.13 Electricity supply system

Guide:
 * If there are sub-station doorways, then they must be protected with fire doors to prevent fire spread.
 * If additional requirements exist in State or Territory authorities for sub-station construction, then they should be followed.
 * If there is a main switchboard, then it should be separated from the rest of the building by fire-resistant construction, with fire doors protecting door openings.
 * If there are electrical conductors, then they must comply with relevant standards or be protected by fire-resistant construction.
 * If emergency equipment is present, it should not rely on battery backup or alternative power sources through the main switchboard.
 * If there is switchgear with both non-emergency and emergency equipment, then physical segregation should be provided to reduce fire damage.
 * If there are switchboards with emergency equipment, then they must be separated from non-emergency equipment by metal partitions. 
 * If there is a need to segregate emergency equipment, then specific equipment listed in C2.13(e) should be separated from non-emergency equipment in a switchboard.
